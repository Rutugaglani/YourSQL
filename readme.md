<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project :white_check_mark:

As a developer we use databases all the time, but they were always a black box for me. This was an attempt to actually understand databases, how they work internally and many more things!

### Here's what we learnt/explored during the course of the project: :smile:

- What data structures are used by databases internally? and Why?
- What format is data saved in?
- How do databases process queries efficiently?
- How are indexes formatted?
- When does data move from memory to disk?

#### In short, how do databases work!

### Working :computer:

- Compile the db.cpp file.

  ![Working 1](./assets/Implementation1.PNG)

- Enter the name of database during runtime. If the database already exists then it will load the file or else it will create a new file.

- **Insert Clause**

  ```SQL
  INSERT id, username, email;
  ```

  ![Working 2](./assets/Implementation2.PNG)
  **Note :** If the query syntax is not followed it throws a syntax error.
  Note: The column ‚Äúid‚Äù is the primary key and therefore has to be unique. If the id is repeated the database will throw an error.
  ![Working 3](./assets/Implementation3.PNG)

- **Select Clause**<br/>
  To select all rows in a table :

  ```SQL
  SELECT;
  ```

  ![Working 7](./assets/Implementation7.PNG)

  To query a particular row/attribute :

  ```SQL
  SELECT *column*  WHERE *column* *column-value*;
  ```

  ![Working 4](./assets/Implementation4.PNG)

- **Update Clause**

  Updates a particular column value inside a row in the table.

  ```SQL
   UPDATE id column_name new_value;;
  ```

  ![Working 5](./assets/Implementation5.PNG)

- **Exit Statement**

  Closes the connection to the database and writes the updates(if any) to the database file.
  ![Working 6](./assets/Implementation6.PNG)

### Built With :hammer:

The entire project was written in C++ for performing fast and efficient database queries.

- [C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/)

### Architecture :construction_worker:

The entire architecture of a DBMS is broken down into 4 major parts:

1. The core
2. SQL Compiler
3. Backend
4. Accessories

![Architecture](./assets/Architecture.jpg)

### 1. The core

- The Core consists of Interface, SQL Command Processor and Virtual Machine.

- Interface is a medium by which the user will interact with the database through SQL
  queries.
- SQL Command Processor redirects the query to the SQL compiler
- Virtual machines interact with the core/backend of the database system.

### 2. SQL Compiler

- The SQL Compiler consists of Tokenizer, Parser and Code Generator.
- Tokenizer breaks the inputted SQL query into tokens and forwards it to the parser.
- Parser assigns meaning to tokens based on their context and assembles them into a parse
  tree. It checks the correctness of the syntax, if correct then it redirects/calls the routines that
  are expected to be performed.
- Code Generator runs to analyze the parse tree and generate bytecode that performs the
  work of the SQL statement.

### 3. Backend

- The Backend consists of B+ Trees, Pager and OS Interface.
- B+ Trees is the internal data structure that will be used to store the pages inside the
  database.
- Pager: Every table is broken down into pages and internally each page is made up of rows.

![Table_Page_Row_Architecture](./assets/Table_Page_Row_Architecture.png)

A row is nothing but a database entry. The pager does the function of breaking down the
rows into pages, gives the page number from the row number, etc.

- OS interface handles the task of reading/writing data from the database file stored in the
  system.

### 4. Accessories

- The Accessories consists of Utilities and Test Code.
- Utilities: Memory allocation, caseless string comparison routines, portable text-to-number
  and conversion routines are included under utilities. Symbol tables used by the parser are
  maintained by hash tables in utilities.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started :boom:

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps:

### Prerequisites

To get started you need to have `G++ compiler` installed on your machine. You can download it from [Here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/).

<!-- - npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ``` -->

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yash-chad/YourSQL.git
   ```
2. Compile the source file
   ```sh
   g++ db.cpp
   ```
3. Run the generated execulatbe file `db.exe`.
   ```cpp
   ./a.exe db.ysql
   ```
   **_Note_** : You need to mention the name of the database file you wish to use. The file will get created if it does not already exists.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
